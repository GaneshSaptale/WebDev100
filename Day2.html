      A <strong>galaxy</strong> is a massive collection of stars, gas, dust, and
      dark matter that are held together by gravity. The word "galaxy" comes
      from the Greek word "galaxias," which means "milky," referring to the
      Milky Way galaxy that contains our Solar System. Galaxies come in
      different shapes and sizes, ranging from dwarfs with less than a hundred
      million stars to supergiants with one hundred trillion stars. The Milky
      Way, our home galaxy, is estimated to have around 100 billion stars.
      Galaxies are categorized based on their visual morphology as elliptical,
      spiral, or irregular. They are also thought to have supermassive black
      holes at their centers. The study of galaxies is an active area of
      research in astronomy and astrophysics.
